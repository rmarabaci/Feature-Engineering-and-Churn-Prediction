Feature Engineering and a machine learning model that can make Churn Analysis

A machine learning model has been developed that can predict which customers are likely to leave the company. The data analysis steps involved identifying the features that are most likely to be associated with customer churn. The feature engineering steps involved transforming the data into a format that is suitable for the machine learning algorithm.
